# telegram-footballmanager-bot
The bot is a CRUD application that registers/deregisters players to the game list via chat.

This is my first pet-project written on Java using Spring / Hibernate frameworks. 
The main function of the bot is to manage the list of players registered to the upcoming actual football game.
It has basic CRUD operations with PostgreSQL.
